# Azure Resource Group

Deploys an [Azure Resource Group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_group).

## Quick start

Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be including them in other Terraform configurations. 

See [examples/storage-account](../../../examples/storage-account) that deploys a Storage Account inside a Resource Group.
